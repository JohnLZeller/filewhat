A .eslintrc file is used to set lint configurations for use by ESLint, which is an open source JavaScript linting utility. Code linting is a type of static analysis that is frequently used to find problematic patterns or code that doesn't adhere to certain style guidelines.

ESLint accepts configuration in many formats, including: .eslintrc.js, .eslintrc.yaml, .eslintrc.yml, .eslintrc.json, .eslintrc, and package.json
