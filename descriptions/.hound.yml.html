A .hound.yml file is used to configure Hound, which is a service that comments on style violations in GitHub pull requests, aiding in review and keeping clean codebase. This configuration file can tell Hound which linters to enable or disable, specify paths to files that provide custom style rules, and determine which files/directories to ignore.
