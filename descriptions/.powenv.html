A .powenv file is used to specify the environment variables in which worker processes run, on a Rack server spun up by Pow. And Pow is a zero-configuration Rack server for Mac OS X. Before an application boots, Pow attempts to execute two scripts — first .powrc, then .powenv — in the application's root. Any environment variables exported from these scripts are passed along to Rack.
