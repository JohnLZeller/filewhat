A .yardopts file is used to configure the use of Yard, which is a tool used for generating Ruby Documentation. This file goes in the root of your project (or gem archive) and tells which source files, extra files, and formatting options you want to generate your documentation with. This file is a whitespace delimited collection of options that are passed to the yardoc executable, and therefore any valid option in yardoc is valid in the .yardopts file.
