A .eslintignore file is a plain text file where each line is a glob pattern indicating which paths should be omitted from linting by ESLint, which is an open source JavaScript linting utility. Code linting is a type of static analysis that is frequently used to find problematic patterns or code that doesn't adhere to certain style guidelines.
