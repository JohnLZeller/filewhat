A gitattributes file is a simple text file that gives attributes to pathnames. Git attributes are path-specific settings that allow Git to apply some settings only for a subdirectory or subset of files. Each line in gitattributes file is of form: 'pattern	attr1 attr2 ...' When the pattern matches the path in question, the attributes listed on the line are given to the path.

Using attributes, you can do things like specify separate merge strategies for individual files or directories in your project, tell Git how to diff non-text files, or have Git filter content before you check it into or out of Git.
