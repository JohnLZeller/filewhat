A .powrc.html file is used to configure the use of Pow, which is a zero-configuration Rack server for Mac OS X.Before an application boots, Pow attempts to execute two scripts — first .powrc, then .powenv — in the application's root. Any environment variables exported from these scripts are passed along to Rack.
