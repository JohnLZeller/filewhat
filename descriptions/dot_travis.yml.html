A .travis.yml is used to configure the use of Travis CI, which is a hosted, distributed continuous integration service used to build and test projects hosted on GitHub. Travis CI automatically detects when a commit has been made and pushed to a GitHub repository that is using Travis CI, and each time this happens, it will try to build the project and run tests, according to what has been configured in the .travis.yml file.
