A .watchr file is used to specify a set of files/directories to watch for changes through the use of Watchr, which is an agile development tool that monitors a directory tree, and triggers a user defined action whenever an observed file is modified. The .watchr file is a script which contains a set of simple rules that map observed files to an action. Watchr's most typical use is continuous testing, and claims to be a more flexible alternative to autotest.
