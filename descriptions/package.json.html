A package.json file is often used to define various metadata about a project. This is a very generic filename which many services use for configuration and metadata, for instance it's used to give information to npm that allows it to identify the project as well as handle the project's dependencies. Npm is the package manager for JavaScript.

This filename is often used to handle similar configuration with other services as well, including Yarn and ESLint.
