A yarn.lock file is an autogenerated file defining configuration dependencies, and is used by Yarn to get consistent installs across machines, by listing the dependencies you configured in your package.json. Yarn stores exactly which versions of each dependency were installed in this file.

Yarn is a package manager for your code. Code is shared through something called a package (sometimes referred to as a module). A package contains all the code being shared as well as a package.json file which describes the package.
